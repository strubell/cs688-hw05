==========

Restricted Boltzmann machine for a classification problem.

* All of the below assume models in a directory one level up called "models", and data in a directory one level up called "data".

* Generated data and models (e.g. for SVMlight) are also placed in these directories, and will fail if they do not exist.

* Directory names can be changed in `load_data.py`.

* Actual RBM implementation contained in `rbm.py`.
