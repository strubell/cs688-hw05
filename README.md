==========

Restricted Boltzmann machine for predicting missing data.

* All of the below assume models in a directory one level up called "models", and data in a directory one level up called "data".

* Generated data and models are also placed in these directories, and will fail if they do not exist.

* Directory names can be changed in `load_data.py`.

* Actual RBM implementation contained in `rbm.py`.

* To train a model, run train.py

* To predict marginals, run predict.py

* To test on a split of the training data, run test.py
